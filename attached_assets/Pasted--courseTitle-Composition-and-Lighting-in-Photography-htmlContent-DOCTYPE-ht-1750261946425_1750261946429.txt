Students will learn how to use side lighting effectively to highlight textures, utilize reflectors and diffusers for optimal lighting conditions, and apply composition techniques that enhance visual storytelling. Through practical examples and hands-on assignments, students will develop their skills in capturing compelling images.</div></p>\n\n    \n        <div class=\"section\">\n        <h2>  <div class=\"section-title\">Section 1: Side Lighting for Texture</div></h2>\n         <p> <div class=\"section-content\">Side lighting is a powerful tool in photography that can dramatically enhance the texture and form of subjects, especially in three-dimensional objects like sculptures. This technique works best when the light source is at a lower angle, such as during the golden hour shortly after sunrise or before sunset. By positioning your subject in such a way that the light strikes it from the side, you can create strong shadows and highlights that reveal details often overlooked. When shooting sculptures, for instance, focus on how the light interacts with the surface, casting shadows that add depth. Look for interesting angles and features that may come to life through this method, allowing viewers to see textures more vividly and appreciate the craftsmanship of the piece. Experiment with both natural and artificial light to see how the effects change the appearance of your subject.</div></p>\n          <img src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUh\" /></body></html>"
